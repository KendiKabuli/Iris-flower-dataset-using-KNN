# Iris Flower Classification with KNN

**Project Overview**  
This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project using Python to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The project demonstrates the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, including data exploration, training, prediction, and visualization of results.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: **Iris Dataset** (built-in from `scikit-learn`)  
- Features (inputs):
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- Target (output): Flower species
  - Setosa 
  - Versicolor 
  - Virginica

## Tools & Libraries i used:
- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Project Steps
1. Load the Iris dataset and explore its structure.  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
3. Train a KNN model to classify flowers.  
4. Make predictions on test data and evaluate accuracy.  
5. Predict a new flower with user-defined measurements.  
6. Visualize the dataset and the new flower using scatter plots.

## Visualization
- Scatter plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width
- Each species is represented by a different color
- New flower prediction is marked with a black 'X'
